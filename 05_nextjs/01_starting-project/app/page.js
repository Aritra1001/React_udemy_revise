// Next js works with React server components
// Components which require a special environment - Next JS provides such an environment
// React Server Components - Rendered only on the server, never on the client
// A type of app that is not easily built bu react but embraced and supported by next js
// The consoles won't be logging in the client side developer tool of the browser, instead it will be logged
// in the temrinal where we have started the server. This shows that the component is rendered only on the server.

import Link from "next/link"; //used for creating routes. This is similar to the Link tag in react-router-dom.

export default function Home() {
  // console.log("NExt js exeuting....")
